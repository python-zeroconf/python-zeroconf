`Documentation <https://python-zeroconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
    
This is fork of pyzeroconf, Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python,
originally by Paul Scott-Murphy (https://github.com/paulsm/pyzeroconf),
modified by William McBrine (https://github.com/wmcbrine/pyzeroconf).

The original William McBrine's fork note::

    This fork is used in all of my TiVo-related projects: HME for Python
    (and therefore HME/VLC), Network Remote, Remote Proxy, and pyTivo.
    Before this, I was tracking the changes for zeroconf.py in three
    separate repos. I figured I should have an authoritative source.
    
    Although I make changes based on my experience with TiVos, I expect that
    they're generally applicable. This version also includes patches found
    on the now-defunct (?) Launchpad repo of pyzeroconf, and elsewhere
    around the net -- not always well-documented, sorry.

Compatible with:

* Bonjour
* Avahi

Compared to some other Zeroconf/Bonjour/Avahi Python packages, python-zeroconf:

* isn't tied to Bonjour or Avahi
* doesn't use D-Bus
* doesn't force you to use particular event loop or Twisted
* is pip-installable
* has PyPI distribution

Python compatibility
--------------------

* CPython 3.5+
* PyPy3 5.8+

Versioning
----------

This project's versions follow the following pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

* MAJOR version has been 0 so far
* MINOR version is incremented on backward incompatible changes
* PATCH version is incremented on backward compatible changes

Status
------

There are some people using this package. I don't actively use it and as such
any help I can offer with regard to any issues is very limited.

IPv6 support
------------

IPv6 support is relatively new and currently limited, specifically:

* `InterfaceChoice.All` is an alias for `InterfaceChoice.Default` on non-POSIX
  systems.
* On Windows specific interfaces can only be requested as interface indexes,
  not as IP addresses.
* Dual-stack IPv6 sockets are used, which may not be supported everywhere (some
  BSD variants do not have them).
* Listening on localhost (`::1`) does not work. Help with understanding why is
  appreciated.

How to get python-zeroconf?
===========================

* PyPI page https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zeroconf
* GitHub project https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf

The easiest way to install python-zeroconf is using pip::

    pip install zeroconf



How do I use it?
================

Here's an example of browsing for a service:

.. code-block:: python

    from zeroconf import ServiceBrowser, Zeroconf
    
    
    class MyListener:
    
        def remove_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):
            print("Service %s removed" % (name,))
    
        def add_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):
            info = zeroconf.get_service_info(type, name)
            print("Service %s added, service info: %s" % (name, info))
    
    
    zeroconf = Zeroconf()
    listener = MyListener()
    browser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, "_http._tcp.local.", listener)
    try:
        input("Press enter to exit...\n\n")
    finally:
        zeroconf.close()

.. note::

    Discovery and service registration use *all* available network interfaces by default.
    If you want to customize that you need to specify ``interfaces`` argument when
    constructing ``Zeroconf`` object (see the code for details).

If you don't know the name of the service you need to browse for, try:

.. code-block:: python

    from zeroconf import ZeroconfServiceTypes
    print('\n'.join(ZeroconfServiceTypes.find()))

See examples directory for more.

Changelog
=========

0.27.1
------

* Improved the logging situation (includes fixing a false-positive "packets() made no progress
  adding records", thanks to Greg Badros)

0.27.0
------

* Large multi-resource responses are now split into separate packets which fixes a bad
  mdns-repeater/ChromeCast Audio interaction ending with ChromeCast Audio crash (and possibly
  some others) and improves RFC 6762 compliance, thanks to Greg Badros
* Added a warning presented when the listener passed to ServiceBrowser lacks update_service()
  callback
* Added support for finding all services available in the browser example, thanks to Perry Kunder

Backwards incompatible:

* Removed previously deprecated ServiceInfo address constructor parameter and property

0.26.3
------

* Improved readability of logged incoming data, thanks to Erik Montnemery
* Threads are given unique names now to aid debugging, thanks to Erik Montnemery
* Fixed a regression where get_service_info() called within a listener add_service method
  would deadlock, timeout and incorrectly return None, fix thanks to Erik Montnemery, but
  Matt Saxon and Hmmbob were also involved in debugging it.

0.26.2
------

* Added support for multiple types to ServiceBrowser, thanks to J. Nick Koston
* Fixed a race condition where a listener gets a message before the lock is created, thanks to
  J. Nick Koston

0.26.1
------

* Fixed a performance regression introduced in 0.26.0, thanks to J. Nick Koston (this is close in
  spirit to an optimization made in 0.24.5 by the same author)

0.26.0
------

* Fixed a regression where service update listener wasn't called on IP address change (it's called
  on SRV/A/AAAA record changes now), thanks to Matt Saxon

Technically backwards incompatible:

* Service update hook is no longer called on service addition (service added hook is still called),
  this is related to the fix above

0.25.1
------

* Eliminated 5s hangup when calling Zeroconf.close(), thanks to Erik Montnemery

0.25.0
------

* Reverted uniqueness assertions when browsing, they caused a regression

Backwards incompatible:

* Rationalized handling of TXT records. Non-bytes values are converted to str and encoded to bytes
  using UTF-8 now, None values mean value-less attributes. When receiving TXT records no decoding
  is performed now, keys are always bytes and values are either bytes or None in value-less
  attributes.

0.24.5
------

* Fixed issues with shared records being used where they shouldn't be (TXT, SRV, A records are
  unique now), thanks to Matt Saxon
* Stopped unnecessarily excluding host-only interfaces from InterfaceChoice.all as they don't
  forbid multicast, thanks to Andreas Oberritter
* Fixed repr() of IPv6 DNSAddress, thanks to Aldo Hoeben
* Removed duplicate update messages sent to listeners, thanks to Matt Saxon
* Added support for cooperating responders, thanks to Matt Saxon
* Optimized handle_response cache check, thanks to J. Nick Koston
* Fixed memory leak in DNSCache, thanks to J. Nick Koston

0.24.4
------

* Fixed resetting TTL in DNSRecord.reset_ttl(), thanks to Matt Saxon
* Improved various DNS class' string representations, thanks to Jay Hogg

0.24.3
------

* Fixed import-time "TypeError: 'ellipsis' object is not iterable." on CPython 3.5.2

0.24.2
------

* Added support for AWDL interface on macOS (needed and used by the opendrop project but should be
  useful in general), thanks to Milan Stute
* Added missing type hints

0.24.1
------

* Applied some significant performance optimizations, thanks to Jaime van Kessel for the patch and
  to Ghostkeeper for performance measurements
* Fixed flushing outdated cache entries when incoming record is unique, thanks to Michael Hu
* Fixed handling updates of TXT records (they'd not get recorded previously), thanks to Michael Hu

0.24.0
------

* Added IPv6 support, thanks to Dmitry Tantsur
* Added additional recommended records to PTR responses, thanks to Scott Mertz
* Added handling of ENOTCONN being raised during shutdown when using Eventlet, thanks to Tamás Nepusz
* Included the py.typed marker in the package so that type checkers know to use type hints from the
  source code, thanks to Dmitry Tantsur

0.23.0
------

* Added support for MyListener call getting updates to service TXT records, thanks to Matt Saxon
* Added support for multiple addresses when publishing a service, getting/setting single address
  has become deprecated. Change thanks to Dmitry Tantsur

Backwards incompatible:

* Dropped Python 3.4 support

0.22.0
------

* A lot of maintenance work (tooling, typing coverage and improvements, spelling) done, thanks to Ville Skyttä
* Provided saner defaults in ServiceInfo's constructor, thanks to Jorge Miranda
* Fixed service removal packets not being sent on shutdown, thanks to Andrew Bonney
* Added a way to define TTL-s through ServiceInfo contructor parameters, thanks to Andrew Bonney

* Fixed WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) compatibility
* Fixed occasional UnboundLocalError issue

0.20.0
------

* Dropped support for Python 2 (this includes PyPy) and 3.3
* Fixed some class' equality operators
