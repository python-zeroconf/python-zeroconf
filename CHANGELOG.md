## v0.64.0 (2023-06-05)

### Bug Fixes

* fix: always answer QU questions when the exact same packet is received from different sources in sequence (#1178)

If the exact same packet with a QU question is asked from two different sources in a 1s window we end up ignoring the second one as a duplicate. We should still respond in this case because the client wants a unicast response and the question may not be answered by the previous packet since the response may not be multicast.

fix: include NSEC records in initial broadcast when registering a new service

This also revealed that we do not send NSEC records in the initial broadcast. This needed to be fixed in this PR as well for everything to work as expected since all the tests would fail with 2 updates otherwise.

* Replace wait_event_or_timeout internals with async_timeout (#1081)

Its unlikely that https://bugs.python.org/issue39032 and
https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/83213 will be fixed
soon. While we moved away from an asyncio.Condition, we still
has a similar problem with waiting for an asyncio.Event which
wait_event_or_timeout played well with. async_timeout avoids
creating a task so its a bit more efficient. Since we call
these when resolving ServiceInfo, avoiding task creation
will resolve a performance problem when ServiceBrowsers
startup as they tend to create task storms when coupled
with ServiceInfo lookups. ([`7ffea9f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/7ffea9f93e758f75a0eeb9997ff8d9c9d47ec31a))

* Send unicast replies on the same socket the query was received (#952)

When replying to a QU question, we do not know if the sending host is reachable
from all of the sending sockets. We now avoid this problem by replying via
the receiving socket. This was the existing behavior when `InterfaceChoice.Default`
is set.

This change extends the unicast relay behavior to used with `InterfaceChoice.Default`
to apply when `InterfaceChoice.All` or interfaces are explicitly passed when
instantiating a `Zeroconf` instance.

- Probe responses are now always sent immediately as there were cases where they would fail to be answered in time to defend a name.

* Increase timeout in ServiceInfo.request to handle loaded systems (#895)

It can take a few seconds for a loaded system to run the `async_request` coroutine when the event loop is busy or the system is CPU bound (example being Home Assistant startup).  We now add
an additional `_LOADED_SYSTEM_TIMEOUT` (10s) to the `run_coroutine_threadsafe` calls to ensure the coroutine has the total amount of time to run up to its internal timeout (default of 3000ms). 

Ten seconds is a bit large of a timeout; however, its only unused in cases where we wrap other timeouts. We now expect the only instance the `run_coroutine_threadsafe` result timeout will happen in a production circumstance is when someone is running a `ServiceInfo.request()` in a thread and another thread calls `Zeroconf.close()` at just the right moment that the future is never completed unless the system is so loaded that it is nearly unresponsive.

The timeout for `run_coroutine_threadsafe` is the maximum time a thread can cleanly shut down when zeroconf is closed out in another thread, which should always be longer than the underlying thread operation.

* Make ServiceInfo first question QU (#852)

- We want an immediate response when making a request with ServiceInfo
  by asking a QU question, most responders will not delay the response
  and respond right away to our question. This also improves compatibility
  with split networks as we may not have been able to see the response
  otherwise.  If the responder has not multicast the record recently
  it may still choose to do so in addition to responding via unicast

- Reduces traffic when there are multiple zeroconf instances running
  on the network running ServiceBrowsers

- If we don't get an answer on the first try, we ask a QM question
  in the event we can't receive a unicast response for some reason

- This change puts ServiceInfo inline with ServiceBrowser which
  also asks the first question as QU since ServiceInfo is commonly
  called from ServiceBrowser callbacks

* Switch ServiceBrowser query scheduling to use call_later instead of a loop (#849)

- Simplifies scheduling as there is no more need to sleep in a loop as
  we now schedule future callbacks with call_later

- Simplifies cancelation as there is no more coroutine to cancel, only a timer handle
  We no longer have to handle the canceled error and cleaning up the awaitable

- Solves the infrequent test failures in test_backoff and test_integration ([`a8c1623`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/a8c16231881de43adedbedbc3f1ea707c0b457f2))

* Fix spurious failures in ZeroconfServiceTypes tests (#848)

- These tests ran the same test twice in 0.5s and would
  trigger the duplicate packet suppression.  Rather then
  making them run longer, we can disable the suppression

* Limit duplicate packet suppression to 1s intervals (#841)

- Only suppress duplicate packets that happen within the same
  second. Legitimate queriers will retry the question if they
  are suppressed. The limit was reduced to one second to be
  in line with rfc6762:

   To protect the network against excessive packet flooding due to
   software bugs or malicious attack, a Multicast DNS responder MUST NOT
   (except in the one special case of answering probe queries) multicast
   a record on a given interface until at least one second has elapsed
   since the last time that record was multicast on that particular ([`7fb11bf`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/7fb11bfc03c06cbe9ed5a4303b3e632d69665bb1))

There is no need to reinstall dependencies in the CI when we have a cache hit. ([`937be52`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/937be522a42830b27326b5253d49003b57998bc9))

* Make multipacket known answer suppression per interface (#836)

- The suppression was happening per instance of Zeroconf instead
  of per interface. Since the same network can be seen on multiple
  interfaces (usually and wifi and ethernet), this would confuse the
  multi-packet known answer supression since it was not expecting
  to get the same data more than once

* Drop oversize packets before processing them (#826)

- Oversized packets can quickly overwhelm the system and deny
  service to legitimate queriers. In practice this is usually
  due to broken mDNS implementations rather than malicious

* Guard against excessive ServiceBrowser queries from PTR records significantly lower than recommended (#824)

* We now enforce a minimum TTL for PTR records to avoid
ServiceBrowsers generating excessive queries refresh queries.
Apple uses a 15s minimum TTL, however we do not have the same
level of rate limit and safe guards so we use 1/4 of the recommended value. ([`7f6d003`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/7f6d003210244b6f7df133bd474d7ddf64098422))

* Only wake up the query loop when there is a change in the next query time (#818)

The ServiceBrowser query loop (async_browser_task) was being awoken on
every packet because it was using `zeroconf.async_wait` which wakes
up on every new packet.  We only need to awaken the loop when the next time
we are going to send a query has changed.

* Qualify IPv6 link-local addresses with scope_id (#343)

Co-authored-by: Lokesh Prajapati <lokesh.prajapati@ncipher.com>
Co-authored-by: de Angelis, Antonio <Antonio.deAngelis@ncipher.com>

When a service is advertised on an IPv6 address where
the scope is link local, i.e. fe80::/64 (see RFC 4007)
the resolved IPv6 address must be extended with the
scope_id that identifies through the "%" symbol the
local interface to be used when routing to that address.
A new API `parsed_scoped_addresses()` is provided to
return qualified addresses to avoid breaking compatibility
on the existing parsed_addresses(). ([`05bb21b`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/05bb21b9b43f171e30b48fad6a756df49162b557))

- On a busy network that receives many mDNS packets per second, we

* Fix cache handling of records with different TTLs (#729)

- There should only be one unique record in the cache at
  a time as having multiple unique records will different
  TTLs in the cache can result in unexpected behavior since
  some functions returned all matching records and some
  fetched from the right side of the list to return the
  newest record. Intead we now store the records in a dict
  to ensure that the newest record always replaces the same
  unique record and we never have a source of truth problem
  determining the TTL of a record from the cache. ([`88aa610`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/88aa610274bf79aef6c74998f2bfca8c8de0dccb))

* Add tests for the DNSCache class (#728)

- There is currently a bug in the implementation where an entry
  can exist in two places in the cache with different TTLs. Since
  a known answer cannot be both expired and expired at the same
  time, this is a bug that needs to be fixed. ([`ceb79bd`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/ceb79bd7f7bdad434cbe5b4846492cd434ea883b))

* Rename handlers and internals to make it clear what is threadsafe (#726)

- It was too easy to get confused about what was threadsafe and
  what was not threadsafe which lead to unexpected failures.
  Rename functions to make it clear what will be run in the event
  loop and what is expected to be threadsafe ([`f91af79`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f91af79c8779ac235598f5584f439c78b3bdcca2))

* Set stale unique records to expire 1s in the future instead of instant removal (#706)

- Fixes #475

- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762#section-10.2
  Queriers receiving a Multicast DNS response with a TTL of zero SHOULD
  NOT immediately delete the record from the cache, but instead record
  a TTL of 1 and then delete the record one second later.  In the case
  of multiple Multicast DNS responders on the network described in
  Section 6.6 above, if one of the responders shuts down and
  incorrectly sends goodbye packets for its records, it gives the other
  cooperating responders one second to send out their own response to
  "rescue" the records before they expire and are deleted. ([`f3eeecd`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f3eeecd84413b510b9b8e05e2d1f6ad99d0dc37d))

* Use DNSRRSet for known answer suppression (#680)

- DNSRRSet uses hash table lookups under the hood which
  is much faster than the linear searches used by
  DNSRecord.suppressed_by ([`e5ea9bb`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/e5ea9bb6c0a3bce7d05241f275a205ddd9e6b615))

* Permit the ServiceBrowser to browse overlong types (#666)

- At least one type "tivo-videostream" exists in the wild
  so we are permissive about what we will look for, and
  strict about what we will announce.

* Ensure eventloop shutdown is threadsafe (#636)

- Prevent ConnectionResetError from being thrown on
  Windows with ProactorEventLoop on cpython 3.8+ ([`bbbbddf`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/bbbbddf40d78dbd62a84f2439763d0a59211c5b9))

* Clear cache in ZeroconfServiceTypes tests to ensure responses can be mcast before the timeout (#634)

- We prevent the same record from being multicast within 1s
  because of RFC6762 sec 14. Since these test timeout after
  0.5s, the answers they are looking for many be suppressed.
  Since a legitimate querier will retry again later, we need
  to clear the cache to simulate that the record has not
  been multicast recently ([`a0977a1`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/a0977a1ddfd7a7a1abcf74c1d90c18021aebc910))

* Remove unreachable cache check for DNSAddresses (#629)

- The ServiceBrowser would check to see if a DNSAddress was
  already in the cache and return early to avoid sending
  updates when the address already was held in the cache.
  This check was not needed since there is already a check
  a few lines before as `self.zc.cache.get(record)` which
  effectively does the same thing. This lead to the check
  never being covered in the tests and 2 cache lookups when
  only one was needed. ([`2b31612`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/2b31612e3f128b1193da9e0d2640f4e93fab2e3a))

* Fix random test failures due to monkey patching not being undone between tests (#626)

- Switch patching to use unitest.mock.patch to ensure the patch
  is reverted when the test is completed

Fixes #505 ([`5750f7c`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/5750f7ceef0441fe1cedc0d96e7ef5ccc232d875))

    dig -p 5353 @224.0.0.251 media-12.local

  The above query will now see a response ([`3556c22`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/3556c22aacc72e62c318955c084533b70311bcc9))

* Fix flakey test_update_record (#525)

- Ensure enough time has past that the first record update
  was processed before sending the second one ([`f49342c`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f49342cdaff2d012ad23635b49ae746ad71333df))

* Update python compatibility as PyPy3 7.2 is required (#523)

- When the version requirement changed to cpython 3.6, PyPy
  was not bumped as well ([`b37d115`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/b37d115a233b61e2989d1439f65cdd911b86f407))

* Update changelog (#513) ([`3d6c682`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/3d6c68278713a2ca66e27938feedcc451a078369))

* Break out record updating into RecordManager (#512) ([`9a766a2`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/9a766a2a96abd0f105056839b5c30f2ede31ea2e))

* Remove uneeded wait in the Engine thread (#511)

- It is not longer necessary to wait since the socketpair
    was added in #243 which will cause the select to unblock
    when a new socket is added or removed. ([`70b455b`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/70b455ba53ce43e9280c02612e8a89665abd57f6))

* Update changelog for zeroconf.asyncio -> zeroconf.aio (#506) ([`26b7005`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/26b70050ffe7dee4fb34428f285be377d1d8f210))

* Rename zeroconf.asyncio to zeroconf.aio (#503)

- The asyncio name could shadow system asyncio in some cases. If
  zeroconf is in sys.path, this would result in loading zeroconf.asyncio
  when system asyncio was intended.

- An `zeroconf.asyncio` shim module has been added that imports `zeroconf.aio`
  that was available in 0.31 to provide backwards compatibility in 0.32.
  This module will be removed in 0.33 to fix the underlying problem
  detailed in #502 ([`bfca3b4`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/bfca3b46fd9a395f387bd90b68c523a3ca84bde4))

* Update changelog, move breaking changes to the top of the list (#501) ([`9b480bc`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/9b480bc1abb2c2702f60796f2edae76ce03ca5d4))

* Set the TC bit for query packets where the known answers span multiple packets (#494) ([`f04a2eb`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f04a2eb43745eba7c43c9c56179ed1fceb992bd8))

* Ensure packets are properly seperated when exceeding maximum size (#498)

- Ensure that questions that exceed the max packet size are
  moved to the next packet. This fixes DNSQuestions being
  sent in multiple packets in violation of:
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-7.2

- Ensure only one resource record is sent when a record
  exceeds _MAX_MSG_TYPICAL
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-17 ([`e2908c6`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/e2908c6c89802ba7a0ea51ac351da40bce3f1cb6))

* Make a base class for DNSIncoming and DNSOutgoing (#497) ([`38e4b42`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/38e4b42b847e700db52bc51973210efc485d8c23))

* Update internal version check to match docs (3.6+) (#491) ([`20f8b3d`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/20f8b3d6fb8d117b0c3c794c4075a00e117e3f31))

* Remove unused __ne__ code from Python 2 era (#492) ([`f0c02a0`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f0c02a02c1a2d7c914c62479bad4957b06471661))

* Lint before testing in the CI (#488) ([`69880ae`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/69880ae6ca4d4f0a7d476b0271b89adea92b9389))

* Add AsyncServiceBrowser example (#487) ([`ef9334f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/ef9334f1279d029752186bc6f4a1ebff6229bf5b))

* Move threading daemon property into ServiceBrowser class (#486) ([`275765a`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/275765a4fd3b477b79163c04f6411709e14506b9))

* Enable test_integration_with_listener_class test on PyPy (#485) ([`49db96d`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/49db96dae466a602662f4fde1537f62a8c8d3110))

* RecordUpdateListener now uses update_records instead of update_record (#419) ([`0a69aa0`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/0a69aa0d37e13cb2c65ceb5cc3ab0fd7e9d34b22))

* AsyncServiceBrowser must recheck for handlers to call when holding condition (#483)

- There was a short race condition window where the AsyncServiceBrowser
  could add to _handlers_to_call in the Engine thread, have the
  condition notify_all called, but since the AsyncServiceBrowser was
  not yet holding the condition it would not know to stop waiting
  and process the handlers to call. ([`9606936`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/960693628006e23fd13fcaefef915ca0c84401b9))

* Relocate ServiceBrowser wait time calculation to seperate function (#484)

- Eliminate the need to duplicate code between the ServiceBrowser
  and AsyncServiceBrowser to calculate the wait time. ([`9c06ce1`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/9c06ce15db31ebffe3a556896393d48cb786b5d9))

* Switch from using an asyncio.Event to asyncio.Condition for waiting (#482) ([`393910b`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/393910b67ac667a660ee9351cc8f94310937f654))

* ServiceBrowser must recheck for handlers to call when holding condition (#477) ([`8da00ca`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/8da00caf31e007153e10a8038a0a484edea03c2f))

* Provide a helper function to convert milliseconds to seconds (#481) ([`849e9bc`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/849e9bc792c6cc77b879b4761195192bea1720ce))

* Fix AsyncServiceInfo.async_request not waiting long enough (#480)

- The call to async_wait should have been in milliseconds, but
  the time was being passed in seconds which resulted in waiting
  1000x shorter ([`b0c0cdc`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/b0c0cdc6779dc095cf03ebd92652af69800b7bca))

* Add support for updating multiple records at once to ServiceInfo (#474)

- Adds `update_records` method to `ServiceInfo` ([`ed53f62`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/ed53f6283265eb8fb506d4af8fb31bd4eaa7292b))

* Narrow exception catch in DNSAddress.__repr__ to only expected exceptions (#473) ([`b853413`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/b8534130ec31a6be191fcc60615ab2fd02fd8d7a))

* Reduce branching in Zeroconf.handle_response (#467)

- Adds `add_records` and `remove_records` to `DNSCache` to
  permit multiple records to be added or removed in one call

- This change is not enough to remove the too-many-branches
  pylint disable, however when combined with #419 it should
  no longer be needed ([`8a9ae29`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/8a9ae29b6f6643f3625938ac44df66dcc556de46))

* Clear cache between ServiceTypesQuery tests (#466)

- Ensures the test relies on the ZeroconfServiceTypes.find making
  the correct calls instead of the cache from the previous call ([`c3365e1`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/c3365e1fd060cebc63cc42443260bd785077c246))

- Notify listeners will be used by AsyncZeroconf to set
  asyncio.Event objects when new data is received

- Registering a notify listener:
   notify_listener = YourNotifyListener()
   Use zeroconf.add_notify_listener(notify_listener)

- Unregistering a notify listener:
   Use zeroconf.remove_notify_listener(notify_listener)

- Notify listeners must inherit from the NotifyListener

- Uses the same pattern as ZeroconfServiceTypes.find ([`2da6198`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/2da6198b2e60a598580637e80b3bd579c1f845a5))

* Use a dedicated thread for sending outgoing packets with asyncio (#404)

- Sends now go into a queue and are processed by the thread FIFO

- Avoids overwhelming the executor when registering multiple
  services in parallel ([`1e7b46c`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/1e7b46c36f6e0735b44d3edd9740891a2dc0c761))

* Complete ServiceInfo request as soon as all questions are answered (#380)

- Closes a small race condition where there were no questions
  to ask because the cache was populated in between checks ([`3afa5c1`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/3afa5c13f2be956505428c5b01f6ce507845131a))

* Coalesce browser questions scheduled at the same time (#379)

- With multiple types, the ServiceBrowser questions can be
  chatty because it would generate a question packet for
  each type. If multiple types are due to be requested,
  try to combine the questions into a single outgoing
  packet(s) ([`60c1895`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/60c1895e67a6147ab8c6ba7d21d4fe5adec3e590))

* Remove Callable quoting (#371)

- The current minimum supported cpython is 3.6+ which does not need
  the quoting ([`7f45bef`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/7f45bef8db444b0436c5f80b4f4b31b2f1d7ec2f))

* Reduce complexity of ServiceBrowser enqueue_callback (#368)

- The handler key was by name, however ServiceBrowser can have multiple

  remove, or update was overly complex. Reduce the complexity by
  making the key (name, type_) ([`4657a77`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/4657a773690a34c897c80894a10ac33b6edadf8b))

* Separate cache loading from I/O in ServiceInfo (#356)

Provides a load_from_cache method on ServiceInfo that does no I/O

- When a ServiceBrowser is running for a type there is no need
  to make queries on the network since the entries will already
  be in the cache. When discovering many devices making queries
  that will almost certainly fail for offline devices delays the
  startup of online devices.

- The DNSEntry and ServiceInfo classes were matching on the name
  instead of the key (lowercase name). These classes now treat dns
  names the same reguardless of case.

  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-16
  > The simple rules for case-insensitivity in Unicast DNS [RFC1034]
  > [RFC1035] also apply in Multicast DNS; that is to say, in name
  > comparisons, the lowercase letters "a" to "z" (0x61 to 0x7A) match
  > their uppercase equivalents "A" to "Z" (0x41 to 0x5A).  Hence, if a
  > querier issues a query for an address record with the name
  > "myprinter.local.", then a responder having an address record with
  > the name "MyPrinter.local." should issue a response. ([`87ba2a3`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/87ba2a3960576cfcf4207ea74a711b2c0cc584a7))

* Provide an asyncio class for service registration (#347)

* Provide an AIO wrapper for service registration

- When using zeroconf with async code, service registration can cause the
  executor to overload when registering multiple services since each one
  will have to wait a bit between sending the broadcast. An aio subclass
  is now available as aio.AsyncZeroconf that implements the following

    - async_register_service
    - async_unregister_service
    - async_update_service
    - async_close

  I/O is currently run in the executor to provide backwards compat with
  existing use cases.

  These functions avoid overloading the executor by waiting in the event
  loop instead of the executor threads. ([`a41d7b8`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/a41d7b8aa5572f3faf29eb087cc18a1343bbcdfa))

* Eliminate the reaper thread (#349)

- Cache is now purged between reads when the interval is reached

- Reduce locking since we are already making a copy of the readers
  and not reading under the lock

- Simplify shutdown process ([`7816278`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/781627864efbb3c8285e1b75144d688083414cf3))

* Return early when already closed (#350)

- Reduce indentation with a return early guard in close ([`523aefb`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/523aefb0b0c477489e4e1e4ab763ce56c57295b7))

* Simplify cache iteration (#340)

- Remove the need to trap runtime error
- Only copy the names of the keys when iterating the cache
- Fixes RuntimeError: list changed size during iterating entries_from_name
- Cache services
- The Repear thread is no longer aware of the cache internals ([`fe94810`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/fe948105cc0923336ffa6d93cbe7d45470612a36))

* Switch from Travis CI/Coveralls to GH Actions/Codecov

Travis CI free tier is going away and Codecov is my go-to code coverage
service now.

Closes GH-332. ([`bd80d20`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/bd80d20682c0af5e15a4b7102dcfe814cdba3a01))

* Drop Python 3.5 compatibilty, it reached its end of life ([`ab67a7a`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/ab67a7aecd63042178061f0d1a76f9a7f6e1559a))

* Use a single socket for InterfaceChoice.Default

When using multiple sockets with multi-cast, the outgoing
socket's responses could be read back on the incoming socket,
which leads to duplicate processing and could fill up the
incoming buffer before it could be processed.

This behavior manifested with error similar to
`OSError: [Errno 105] No buffer space available`

By using a single socket with InterfaceChoice.Default
we avoid this case. ([`6beefbb`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/6beefbbe76a0e261394b308c8cc68545be653019))

## v0.28.8 (2021-01-04)

### Unknown

* Release version 0.28.8 ([`1d726b5`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/1d726b551a49e945b134df6e29b352697030c5a9))

* Ensure the name cache is rolled back when the packet reaches maximum size

If the packet was too large, it would be rolled back at the end of write_record.
We need to remove the names that were added to the name cache (self.names)
as well to avoid a case were we would create a pointer to a name that was
rolled back.

The size of the packet was incorrect at the end after the inserts because
insert_short would increase self.size even though it was already accounted
before. To resolve this insert_short_at_start was added which does not
increase self.size. This did not cause an actual bug, however it sure
made debugging this problem far more difficult.

Additionally the size now inserted and then replaced when the actual
size is known because it made debugging quite difficult since the size
did not previously agree with the data. ([`86b4e11`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/86b4e11434d44e2f9a42354109a10f601c44d66a))


## v0.28.7 (2020-12-13)

* Release version 0.28.7 ([`8f7effd`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/8f7effd2f89c542162d0e5ac257c561501690d16))

* Refactor to move service registration into a registry

This permits removing the broad exception catch that
was expanded to avoid a crash in when adding or
removing a service ([`2708fef`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/2708fef6052f7e6e6eb36a157438b316e6d38b21))

* Prevent crash when a service is added or removed during handle_response

Services are now modified under a lock.  The service processing
is now done in a try block to ensure RuntimeError is caught
which prevents the zeroconf engine from unexpectedly
terminating. ([`4136858`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/41368588e5fcc6ec9596f306e39e2eaac2a9ec18))

* Restore IPv6 addresses output

Before this change, script `examples/browser.py` printed IPv4 only, even with `--v6` argument.
With this change, `examples/browser.py` prints both IPv4 + IPv6 by default, and IPv6 only with `--v6-only` argument.

I took the idea from the fork
https://github.com/ad3angel1s/python-zeroconf/blob/master/examples/browser.py ([`4da1612`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/4da1612b728acbcf2ab0c4bee09891c46f387bfb))

* Merge strict and allow_underscores (#309)

Those really serve the same purpose -- are we receiving data (and want
to be flexible) or registering services (and want to be strict). ([`6a0c5dd`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/6a0c5dd4e84c30264747847e8f1045ece2a14288))

* Loosen validation to ensure get_service_info can handle production devices (#307)

Validation of names was too strict and rejected devices that are otherwise
functional.  A partial list of devices that unexpectedly triggered
a BadTypeInNameException:

  Bose Soundtouch
  Yeelights
  Rachio Sprinklers
  iDevices ([`6ab0cd0`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/6ab0cd0a0446f158a1d8a64a3bc548cf9e103179))


## v0.28.5 (2020-09-11)

### Unknown

* Release version 0.28.5 ([`eda1b3d`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/eda1b3dd17329c40a59b628b4bbca15c42af43b7))

* Fix AttributeError: module 'unittest' has no attribute 'mock' (#302)

We only had module-level unittest import before now, but code accessing
mock through unittest.mock was working because we have a test-level
import from unittest.mock which causes unittest to gain the mock
attribute and if the test was run before other tests (those using
unittest.mock.patch) all was good. If the test was not run before them,
though, they'd fail.

Closes GH-295. ([`2db7fff`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/2db7fff033937a929cdfee1fc7c93c594872799e))

* Ignore duplicate messages (#299)

When watching packet captures, I noticed that zeroconf was processing
incoming data 3x on a my Home Assistant OS install because there are
three interfaces.

We can skip processing duplicate packets in order to reduce the overhead
of decoding data we have already processed.

* Add ServiceListener to __all__ for Zeroconf module (#298)

It's part of the public API. ([`0265a9d`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/0265a9d57630a4a19bcd3638a6bb3f4b18eba01b))

* Avoid copying the entires cache and reduce frequency of Reaper

The cache reaper was running at least every 10 seconds, making
a copy of the cache, and iterated all the entries to
check if they were expired so they could be removed.

In practice the reaper was actually running much more frequently
because it used self.zc.wait which would unblock any time
a record was updated, a listener was added, or when a
listener was removed.

This change ensures the reaper frequency is only every 10s, and
will first attempt to iterate the cache before falling back to
making a copy.

Previously it made sense to expire the cache more frequently
because we had places were we frequently had to enumerate
all the cache entries. With #247 and #232 we no longer
have to account for this concern.

On a mostly idle RPi running HomeAssistant and a busy
network the total time spent reaping the cache was
more than the total time spent processing the mDNS traffic.

* Ensure all listeners are cleaned up on ServiceBrowser cancelation (#290)

When creating listeners for a ServiceBrowser with multiple types
they would not all be removed on cancelation. This led
to a build up of stale listeners when ServiceBrowsers were
frequently added and removed. ([`c9f3c91`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/c9f3c91da568fdbd26d571eed8a636a49e527b15))

* Fix an OS X edge case (#270, #188)

This contains two major changes:

* Listen on data from respond_sockets in addition to listen_socket
* Do not bind respond sockets to 0.0.0.0 or ::/0

The description of the original change by Emil:

<<<
Without either of these changes, I get no replies at all when browsing for
services using the browser example. I'm on a corporate network, and when
connecting to a different network it works without these changes, so maybe
it's something about the network configuration in this particular network
that breaks the previous behavior.

Unfortunately, I have no idea how this affects other platforms, or what
the changes really mean. However, it works for me and it seems reasonable
to get replies back on the same socket where they are sent.
>>>

The tests pass and it's been confirmed to a reasonable degree that this
doesn't break the previously working use cases.

Additionally this removes a memory leak where data sent to some of the
respond sockets would not be ever read from them (#171).

* Add support for passing text addresses to ServiceInfo

Not sure if parsed_addresses is the best way to name the parameter, but
we already have a parsed_addresses property so for the sake of
consistency let's stick to that. ([`0a9aa8d`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/0a9aa8d31bffec5d7b7291b84fbc95222b10d189))

* Support Windows when using socket errno checks (#274)

Windows reports errno.WSAEINVAL(10022) instead of errno.EINVAL(22).
This issue is triggered when a device has two IP's assigned under
windows.

This fixes #189 ([`c31ae7f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/c31ae7fd519df04f41939d3c60c2b88960737fd6))

* Warn on every call to missing update_service() listener method

This is in order to provide visibility to the library users that this
method exists - without it the client code may be missing data. ([`488ee1e`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/488ee1e85762dc5856d8e132da54762e5e712c5a))

* Separately send large mDNS responses to comply with RFC 6762 (#248)

This fixes issue #245

Split up large multi-response packets into separate packets instead of relying on IP Fragmentation. IP Fragmentation of mDNS packets causes ChromeCast Audios to
crash their mDNS responder processes and RFC 6762
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) section 17 states some
requirements for Multicast DNS Message Size, and the fourth paragraph reads:

"A Multicast DNS packet larger than the interface MTU, which is sent
using fragments, MUST NOT contain more than one resource record."

This change makes this implementation conform with this MUST NOT clause. ([`87a0fe2`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/87a0fe27a7be9d96af08f8a007f37a16105c64a0))

## v0.26.3 (2020-05-26)

### Unknown

* Release version 0.26.3 ([`fbcefca`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/fbcefca592632304579c1b3f9c7bd3dd342e1618))

* Don't call callbacks when holding _handlers_lock (#258)

Closes #255

Background:
#239 adds the lock _handlers_lock:

python-zeroconf/zeroconf/__init__.py

    self._handlers_lock = threading.Lock()  # ensure we process a full message in one go 

Which is used in the engine thread:

     def handle_response(self, msg: DNSIncoming) -> None: 
         """Deal with incoming response packets.  All answers 
         are held in the cache, and listeners are notified.""" 
  
         with self._handlers_lock: 
  

And also by the service browser when issuing the state change callbacks:

 if len(self._handlers_to_call) > 0 and not self.zc.done: 
     with self.zc._handlers_lock: 
         handler = self._handlers_to_call.popitem(False) 
         self._service_state_changed.fire( 
             zeroconf=self.zc, service_type=self.type, name=handler[0], state_change=handler[1] 
         ) 

Both pychromecast and Home Assistant calls Zeroconf.get_service_info from the service callbacks which means the lock may be held for several seconds which will starve the engine thread. ([`fe86566`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/fe865667e4610d57067a8f710f4d818eaa5e14dc))

* Give threads unique names (#257) ([`54d116f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/54d116fd69a66062f91be04d84ceaebcfb13cc43))

* Use equality comparison instead of identity comparison for ints

Integers aren't guaranteed to have the same identity even though they
may be equal. ([`445d7f5`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/445d7f5dbe38947bd0bd1e3a5b8d649c1819c21f))

* Merge 0.26.2 release commit

I accidentally only pushed 0.26.2 tag (commit ffb42e5836bd) without
pushing the commit to master and now I merged aa9de4de7202 so this is
the best I can do without force-pushing to master. Tag 0.26.2 will
continue to point to that dangling commit. ([`1c4d3fc`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/1c4d3fcbf34b09364e52a773783dc9c924a7b17a))

* Add support for multiple types to ServiceBrowsers

As each ServiceBrowser runs in its own thread there
is a scale problem when listening for many types.

ServiceBrowser can now accept a list of types
in addition to a single type. ([`a6ad100`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/a6ad100a60e8434cef6b411208eef98f68d594d3))

* Avoid iterating the entire cache when an A/AAAA address has not changed (#247)

Iterating the cache is an expensive operation
when there is 100s of devices generating zeroconf

cache. ([`0540342`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/0540342bacd859f38f6d2a3743a7959cd3ae4d02))

* Call UpdateService on SRV & A/AAAA updates as well as TXT (#239)

Fix https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf/issues/235

Contains:

* Add lock around handlers list
* Reverse DNSCache order to ensure newest records take precedence

  When there are multiple records in the cache, the behaviour was
  inconsistent. Whilst the DNSCache.get() method returned the newest,
  any function which iterated over the entire cache suffered from
  a last write winds issue. This change makes this behaviour consistent
  and allows the removal of an (incorrect) wait from one of the unit tests. ([`552a030`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/552a030eb592a0c07feaa7a01ece1464da4b1d0b))

* Switch to pytest for test running (#240)

Nose is dead for all intents and purposes (last release in 2015) and
pytest provide a very valuable feature of printing relevant extra
information in case of assertion failure (from[1]):

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________

        def test_answer():
    >       assert func(3) == 5
    E       assert 4 == 5
    E        +  where 4 = func(3)

    test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 4 == 5
    ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================

This should be helpful in debugging tests intermittently failing on
PyPy.

Several TestCase.assertEqual() calls have been replaced by plain
assertions now that that method no longer provides anything we can't get
without it. Few assertions have been modified to not explicitly provide
extra information in case of failure – pytest will provide this
automatically.

Dev dependencies are forced to be the latest versions to make sure
we don't fail because of outdated ones on Travis.

* Remove uniqueness assertions

The assertions, added in [1] and modified in [2] introduced a
regression. When browsing in the presence of devices advertising SRV
records not marked as unique there would be an undesired crash (from [3]):

The intention is to bring those assertions back in a way that only
enforces uniqueness when sending records, not when receiving them.

## v0.24.5 (2020-03-08)

* Release version 0.24.5 ([`aba2858`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/aba28583f5431f584587770b6c149e4a607a987e))

* Resolve memory leak in DNSCache

When all the records for a given name were removed from the cache, the
name itself that contain the list was never removed.  This left an empty list
in memory for every device that was no longer broadcasting on the
network. ([`eac53f4`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/eac53f45bddb8d3d559b1d4672a926b746435771))

* Optimize handle_response cache check

The handle_response loop would encounter a unique record
it would search the cache in order to remove keys that
matched the DNSEntry for the record.

Since the cache is stored as a list of records with the key as the record name,
 we can avoid searching the entire cache each time and on
search for the DNSEntry of the record. In practice this means
with 5000 entries and records in the cache we now only need to search
4 or 5.

When looping over the cache entries for the name, we now check the expire time
first as its cheaper than calling DNSEntry.__eq__

Test environment:

  Home Assistant running on home networking with a /22
  and a significant amount of broadcast traffic

* Support cooperating responders (#224) ([`1ca023f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/1ca023fae4b586679446ceaf3e2e9955ea5bf180))

* Remove duplciate update messages sent to listeners

The prior code used to send updates even when the new record was identical to the old.

This resulted in duplciate update messages when there was in fact no update (apart from TTL refresh) ([`d8caa4e`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/d8caa4e2d71025ed42b33abb4d329329437b44fb))

* Do not exclude interfaces with host-only netmasks from InterfaceChoice.All (#227)

Host-only netmasks do not forbid multicast.

Tested on Debian 10 running in Qubes and on Ubuntu 18.04. ([`ca8e53d`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/ca8e53de55a563f5c7049be2eda14ae0ecd1a7cf))

* Ensure all TXT, SRV, A records are unique

Fixes issues with shared records being used where they shouldn't be.

PTR records should be shared, but SRV, TXT and A/AAAA records should be unique.

Whilst mDNS and DNS-SD in theory support shared records for these types of record, they are not implemented in python-zeroconf at the moment.

See zeroconf.check_service() method which verifies the service is unique on the network before registering. ([`bef8f59`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/bef8f593ae820eb8465934de91eb27468edf6444))


## v0.24.4 (2019-12-30)

* Update DNS entries so all subclasses of DNSRecord use to_string for display

All records based on DNSRecord now properly use to_string in repr, some were
only dumping the answer without the question (inconsistent). ([`8ccad54`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/8ccad54dab4a0ab7f573996f6fc0c2f2bad7eafe))

* Fix resetting of TTL (#209)

Fix resetting of TTL

Previously the reset_ttl method changed the time created and the TTL value, but did not change the expiration time or stale times. As a result a record would expire even when this method had been called. ([`b47efd8`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/b47efd8eed0b5ed9d3b6bca8573a6ed1916c982a))


## v0.24.3 (2019-12-23)

### Unknown

* Fix import-time TypeError on CPython 3.5.2

The error: TypeError: 'ellipsis' object is not iterable."

Explanation can be found here: https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf/issues/208

Closes GH-208. ([`f53e24b`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f53e24bddb3a6cb242cace2a541ed507e823be33))


## v0.24.2 (2019-12-17)

### Unknown

* Release version 0.24.2 ([`76bc675`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/76bc67532ad26f54c194e1e6537d2da4390f83e2))

* Provide and enforce type hints everywhere except for tests

The tests' time will come too in the future, though, I think. I believe
nose has problems with running annotated tests right now so let's leave
it for later.

DNSEntry.to_string renamed to entry_to_string because DNSRecord
subclasses DNSEntry and overrides to_string with a different signature,
so just to be explicit and obvious here I renamed it – I don't think any
client code will break because of this.

I got rid of ServicePropertiesType in favor of generic Dict because
having to type all the properties got annoying when variance got
involved – maybe it'll be restored in the future but it seems like too
much hassle now. ([`f771587`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f7715874c2242b95cf9815549344ea66ac107b6e))

* Fix get_expiration_time percent parameter annotation

It takes integer percentage values at the moment so let's document that. ([`5986bf6`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/5986bf66e77e77f9e0b6ba43a4758ecb0da04ff6))

* Add support for AWDL interface on macOS

The API is inspired by Apple's NetService.includesPeerToPeer
(see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/netservice/1414086-includespeertopeer) ([`fcafdc1`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/fcafdc1e285cc5c3c1f2c413ac9309d3426179f4))


## v0.24.1 (2019-12-16)

### Unknown

* Release version 0.24.1 ([`53dd06c`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/53dd06c37f6205129e81f5c6b69e508a54f94d07))

* Bugfix: TXT record's name is never equal to Service Browser's type.

TXT record's name is never equal to Service Browser's type. We should
check whether TXT record's name ends with Service Browser's type.
Otherwise, we never get updates of TXT records. ([`2a597ee`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/2a597ee80906a27effd442d033de10b5129e6900))

* Bugfix: Flush outdated cache entries when incoming record is unique.

According to RFC 6762 10.2. Announcements to Flush Outdated Cache Entries,
when the incoming record's cache-flush bit is set (record.unique == True
in this module), "Instead of merging this new record additively into the
cache in addition to any previous records with the same name, rrtype, and
rrclass, all old records with that name, rrtype, and rrclass that were
received more than one second ago are declared invalid, and marked to
expire from the cache in one second." ([`1d39b3e`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/1d39b3edd141093f9e579ab83377fe8f5ecb357d))

* Change order of equality check to favor cheaper checks first

Comparing two strings is much cheaper than isinstance, so we should try
those first

A performance test was run on a network with 170 devices running Zeroconf.
There was a ServiceBrowser running on a separate thread while a timer ran
on the main thread that forced a thread switch every 2 seconds (to include
the effect of thread switching in the measurements). Every minute,
a Zeroconf broadcast was made on the network.

This was ran this for an hour on a Macbook Air from 2015 (Intel Core
i7-5650U) using Ubuntu 19.10 and Python 3.7, both before this commit and
after.

These are the results of the performance tests:
Function		Before count		Before time	Before time per count	After count		After time		After time per count	Time reduction
DNSEntry.__eq__		528			0.001s		1.9μs			538			0.001s			1.9μs			1.9%

* Dont recalculate the expiration and stale time every update

I have a network with 170 devices running Zeroconf. Every minute
a zeroconf request for broadcast is cast out. Then we were listening for
Zeroconf devices on that network.

To get a more realistic test, the Zeroconf ServiceBrowser is ran on
a separate thread from a main thread. On the main thread an I/O limited
call to QNetworkManager is made every 2 seconds,

in order to include performance penalties due to thread switching. The
experiment was ran on a MacBook Air 2015 (Intel Core i7-5650U) through
Ubuntu 19.10 and Python 3.7.

This was left running for exactly one hour, both before and after this commit.

Before this commit, there were 132107499 (132M) calls to the
get_expiration_time function, totalling 141.647s (just over 2 minutes).

After this commit, there were 1661203 (1.6M) calls to the
get_expiration_time function, totalling 2.068s.

This saved about 2 minutes of processing time out of the total 60 minutes,
on average 3.88% processing power on the tested CPU. It is expected to see
similar improvements on all CPU architectures. ([`2e9699c`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/2e9699c542f691fc605e4a1c03cbf496273a9835))

* Significantly improve the speed of the entries function of the cache

Tested this with Python 3.6.8, Fedora 28. This was done in a network with
a lot of discoverable devices.

* ENOTCONN is not an error during shutdown

When `python-zeroconf` is used in conjunction with `eventlet`, `select.select()` will return with an error code equal to `errno.ENOTCONN` instead of `errno.EBADF`. As a consequence, an exception is shown in the console during shutdown. I believe that it should not cause any harm to treat `errno.ENOTCONN` the same way as `errno.EBADF` to prevent this exception. ([`c86423a`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/c86423ab0223bab682614e18a6a09050dfc80087))

* Rework exposing IPv6 addresses on ServiceInfo

* Return backward compatibility for ServiceInfo.addresses by making
  it return V4 addresses only
* Add ServiceInfo.parsed_addresses for convenient access to addresses
* Raise TypeError if addresses are not provided as bytes (otherwise
  an ugly assertion error is raised when sending)
* Add more IPv6 unit tests ([`98a1ce8`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/98a1ce8b99ddb03de9f6cccca49396fcf177e0d0))

* Make AAAA records work (closes #52) (#191)

This PR incorporates changes from the earlier PR #179 (thanks to Mikael Pahmp), adding tests and a few more fixes to make AAAA records work in practice.

Note that changing addresses to container IPv6 addresses may be considered a breaking change, for example, for consumers that unconditionally apply inet_aton to them. I'm introducing a new function to be able to retries only addresses from one family. ([`5bb9531`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/5bb9531be48f6f1e119643677c36d9e714204a8b))

* Add additional recommended records to PTR responses (#184)

RFC6763 indicates a server should include the SRV/TXT/A/AAAA records
when responding to a PTR record request.  This optimization ensures
the client doesn't have to then query for these additional records.

It has been observed that when multiple Windows 10 machines are monitoring
for the same service, this unoptimized response to the PTR record
request can cause extremely high CPU usage in both the DHCP Client
& Device Association service (I suspect due to all clients having to
then sending/receiving the additional queries/responses). ([`ea64265`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/ea6426547f79c32c6d5d3bcc2d0a261bf503197a))

* First stab at supporting listening on IPv6 interfaces

This change adds basic support for listening on IPv6 interfaces.
Some limitations exist for non-POSIX platforms, pending fixes in
Python and in the ifaddr library. Also dual V4-V6 sockets may not
work on all BSD platforms. As a result, V4-only is used by default.

Unfortunately, Travis does not seem to support IPv6, so the tests
are disabled on it, which also leads to coverage decrease. ([`3d5787b`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/3d5787b8c5a92304b70c04f48dc7d5cec8d9aac8))


## v0.23.0 (2019-06-04)

### Unknown

* Release version 0.23.0 ([`7bd0436`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/7bd04363c7ff0f583a17cc2fac42f9a9c1724769))

* Add support for multiple addresses when publishing a service (#170)

This is a rebased and fixed version of PR #27, which also adds compatibility shim for ServiceInfo.address and does a proper deprecation for it.

* Present all addresses that are available.

* Add support for publishing multiple addresses.

* Add test for backwards compatibility.

* Provide proper deprecation of the "address" argument and field

* Raise deprecation warnings when address is used
* Add a compatibility property to avoid breaking existing code
  (based on suggestion by Bas Stottelaar in PR #27)
* Make addresses keyword-only, so that address can be eventually
  removed and replaced with it without breaking consumers
* Raise TypeError instead of an assertion on conflicting address
  and addresses

* Disable black on ServiceInfo.__init__ until black is fixed

Due to https://github.com/python/black/issues/759 black produces
code that is invalid Python 3.5 syntax even with --target-version py35.
This patch disables reformatting for this call (it doesn't seem to be
possible per line) until it's fixed. ([`c787610`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/c7876108150cd251786db4ab52dadd1b2283d262))

* Reformat the code using Black

We could use some style consistency in the project and Black looks like
the best tool for the job.

Two flake8 errors are being silenced from now on:

* E203 whitespace before :
* W503 line break before binary operator

Both are to satisfy Black-formatted code (and W503 is somemwhat against
the latest PEP8 recommendations regarding line breaks and binary
operators in new code). ([`beb596c`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/beb596c345b0764bdfe1a828cfa744bcc560cf32))

* Add support for MyListener call getting updates to service TXT records (2nd attempt) (#166)

Add support for MyListener call getting updates to service TXT records

At the moment, the implementation supports notification to the  ServiceListener class for additions and removals of service, but for service updates to the TXT record, the client must poll the ServiceInfo class. This draft PR provides a mechanism to have a callback on the ServiceListener class be invoked when the TXT record changes.

* Adjust query intervals to match RFC 6762 (#159)

* Limit query backoff time to one hour as-per rfc6762 section 5.2
* tests: monkey patch backoff limit to focus testing on TTL expiry
* tests: speed up integration test
* tests: add test of query backoff interval and limit
* Set initial query interval to 1 second as-per rfc6762 sec 5.2
* Add comments around timing constants
* tests: fix linting errors
* tests: fix float assignment to integer var


Sets the repeated query backoff limit to one hour as opposed to 20 seconds, reducing unnecessary network traffic
Adds a test for the behaviour of the backoff procedure
Sets the first repeated query to happen after one second as opposed to 500ms ([`bee8abd`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/bee8abdba49e2275d203e3b0b4a3afac330ec4ea))

* Run mypy on test_zeroconf.py too

This will reveal issues with current type hints as demonstrated by a
commit/issue to be submitted later, as well as prevent some others
from cropping up meanwhile. ([`74391d5`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/74391d5c124bf6f899059db93bbf7e99b96d8aad))

* Modify ServiceInfo's __init__ properties' default value.

This commit modifies the default value of the argument properties of
ServiceInfo’s __init__() to byte array (properties=b’’). This enables
to instantiate it without setting the properties argument. As it is,
and because properties is not mandatory, if a user does not specify
the argument, an exception (AssertionError) is thrown:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "src/zeroconf-test.py", line 72, in <module>

The argument can be either a dictionary or a byte array. The function
_set_properties() will always create a byte array with the user's
properties. Changing the default value to a byte array, avoids the
conversion to byte array and avoids the exception. ([`9321007`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/93210079259bd0973e3b54a90dff971e14abf595))

* Introduce some static type analysis to the codebase

The main purpose of this change is to make the code easier to read and
explore. Preventing some classes of bugs is a bonus.

On top of just adding type hints and enabling mypy to verify them the
following changes were needed:
* casts in places where we know what we're doing but mypy can't know it
* RecordUpdateListener interfaces extracted out of ServiceBrowser and
  ServiceInfo classes so that we have a common name we can use in places
  where we only need an instance of one of those classes to call to call
  update_record() on it. This way we can keep mypy happy
* assert isinstance(...) blocks to provide hints for mypy as to what
  concrete types we're dealing with
* some local type mixing removed (previously we'd first assign a value
  of one type to a variable and then overwrite with another type)
* explicit "return None" in case of function that returns optionally -
  mypy enforces explicit return in this case ([`1f33c4f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/1f33c4f8a8050cdfb051c0da7ebe80a9ff24cf25))

passed to the log_warning_once() method instead.

* Remove some legacy cruft

The latest versions of flake8 and flake8-import-order can be used just
fine now (they've been ok for some time).

Since with google style flake8-import-order would generate more issues
than with the cryptography style I decided to switch and fix one thing
it complained about.

We switch to pycodestyle instead of pinned pep8 version as that pep8
version can't be installed with latest flake8 and the name of the
package has been changed to pycodestyle. We still pin the version though
as there's a bad interaction between the latest pycodestyle and the
latest flake8. ([`6fe8132`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/6fe813212f46576cf305c17ee815536a83128fce))

* Test Case and fixes for DNSHInfo (#49)

* Fix ability for a cache lookup to match properly

When querying for a service type, the response is processed.  During the
processing, an info lookup is performed.  If the info is not found in
the cache, then a query is sent.  Trouble is that the info requested is
present in the same packet that triggered the lookup, and a query is not
necessary.  But two problems caused the cache lookup to fail.

1) The info was not yet in the cache.  The call back was fired before
all answers in the packet were cached.

2) The test for a cache hit did not work, because the cache hit test
uses a DNSEntry as the comparison object.  But some of the objects in
the cache are descendents of DNSEntry and have their own __eq__()
defined which accesses fields only present on the descendent.  Thus the
test can NEVER work since the descendent's __eq__() will be used.

Also continuing the theme of some other recent pull requests, add three
_GLOBAL_DONE tests to avoid doing work after the attempted stop, and
thus avoid generating (harmless, but annoying) exceptions during
shutdown

* Remove unnecessary packet send in ServiceInfo.request()

When performing an info query via request(), a listener is started, and
a packet is formed. As the packet is formed, known answers are taken
from the cache and placed into the packet.  Then the packet is sent.
The packet is self received (via multicast loopback, I assume).  At that
point the listener is fired and the answers in the packet are propagated
back to the object that started the request.  This is a really long way
around the barn.

The PR queries the cache directly in request() and then calls
update_record().  If all of the information is in the cache, then no
packet is formed or sent or received.  This approach was taken because,
for whatever reason, the reception of the packets on windows via the
loopback was proving to be unreliable.  The method has the side benefit
of being a whole lot faster.

This PR also incorporates the joins() from PR #30.  In addition it moves
the two joins() in close() to their own thread because they can take
quite a while to execute.

* Fix locking race condition in Engine.run()

This fixes a race condition in which the receive engine was waiting
against its condition variable under a different lock than the one it
used to determine if it needed to wait.  This was causing the code to
sometimes take 5 seconds to do anything useful.

When fixing the race condition, decided to also fix the other
correctness issues in the loop which was likely causing the errors that
led to the inclusion of the 'except Exception' catch all.  This in turn
allowed the use of EBADF error due to closing the socket during exit to
be used to get out of the select in a timely manner.

Finally, this allowed reorganizing the shutdown code to shutdown from
the front to the back.  That is to say, shutdown the recv socket first,
which then allows a clean join with the engine thread.  After the engine
thread exits most everything else is inert as all callbacks have been
unwound.

* Remove a now invalid test case

With the restructure of shutdown, Listener() now needs to throw EBADF on
a closed socket to allow a timely and graceful shutdown.

* Shutdown the service listeners in an organized fashion

Also adds names to the various threads to make debugging easier.

* Improve test coverage

Add more needed shutdown cleanup found via additional test coverage.

Force timeout calculation from milli to seconds to use floating point.

* init ServiceInfo._properties

* Add query support and test case for _services._dns-sd._udp.local.

* pep8 cleanup

* Add testcase and fixes for HInfo Record Generation

The DNSHInfo packet generation code was broken. There was no test case for that
functionality, and adding a test case showed four issues. Two of which were
relative to PY3 string, one of which was a typoed reference to an attribute,
and finally the two fields present in the HInfo record were using the wrong
encoding, which is what necessitated the change from write_string() to
write_character_string(). ([`6b39c70`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/6b39c70fa1ed7cfac89e02e2b3764a9038b87267))

* Installation on system with ASCII encoding

The default open function in python2 made a best effort to open text files of any encoding.
After 3.0 the encoding has to be set correctly and it defaults to the user preferences. ([`6007537`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/60075379d57664f94fa41a96dea7c7c64489ef3d))

* Revert "Switch from netifaces to psutil"

psutil doesn't seem to work on pypy3:

Additionally netifaces turns out to be possible to install on Python 3,
therefore making it necessary to investigate the original issue.

This reverts commit dd907f2eed3768a3c1e3889af84b5dbeb700a1e7. ([`6349d19`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/6349d197b442209331a0ff8676541967f7142991))

* fix issue #23 race-condition on ServiceBrowser startup ([`30bd44f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/30bd44f04f94a9b26622a7213dd9950ae57df21c))

* Switch from netifaces to psutil

netifaces installation on Python 3.x is broken and there doesn't seem to
be any plan to release a working version on PyPI, instead of using its
fork I decided to use another package providing the required
information.

This closes https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf/issues/31

* Add a DNSText __repr__ test

The test helps making sure the situation fixed by

* Use enum-compat instead of enum34 directly

This is in order for the package's installation to work on Python 3.4+,
solves the same issue as
https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf/pull/22. ([`ba89455`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/ba894559f43fa6955989b92533c06fd8e8b92c74))

* Fix using binary strings as property values

Previously it'd fall trough and set the value to False ([`b443027`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/b4430274ba8355ceaadc2d89a84752f1ac1485e7))

* Make the code nicer

This includes:

* rearranging code to make it more readable
* catching KeyError instead of all exceptions and making it obvious what
  can possibly raise there
* renaming things ([`df88670`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/df88670963e8c3a1f11a6af026b484ff4343d271))

* Remove duplicates from all interfaces list

It has been mentioned in GH #12 that the list of all machine's network
interfaces can contain duplicates; it shouldn't break anything but
there's no need to open multiple sockets in such case. ([`af5e363`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/af5e363e7fcb392081dc98915defd93c5002c3fc))

* Skip host only network interfaces

On Ubuntu Linux treating such interface (network mask 255.255.255.255)
would result in:

* EADDRINUSE "Address already in use" when trying to add multicast group
  membership using IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
* success when setting the interface as outgoing multicast interface
  using IP_MULTICAST_IF
* EINVAL "Invalid argument" when trying to send multicast datagram using
  socket with that interface set as the multicast outgoing interface ([`b5e9e94`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/b5e9e944e6f3c990862b3b03831bb988579ed340))

* Ignore EADDRINUSE when appropriate

On some systems it's necessary to do so ([`0f7c64f`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/0f7c64f8cdacae34c227edd5da4f445ece12da89))

tested, and this is faster.) ([`f772d4e`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/f772d4e5e208431378bf01d75eddc7df5119dff7))

a step back in some respects (re-inserting tabs that will be undone a
couple patches hence), so that I can apply the patches going forward. ([`d952a9c`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf/commit/d952a9c117ae539cf4778d76618fe813b10a9a34))
